# Super Looper

Practice loops til you're loopy!

## Getting started

Fork it, clone it, run `npm install` and then `npm run test` to reveal 10 failing tests.

Go into `challenges.js` and fix something, and run `npm run test` again to see if you're right!

Make sure you **commit** and **push** frequently so that your coach can see your progress.
